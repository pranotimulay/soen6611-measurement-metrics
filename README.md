# A study of software measurement metrics and correlation between them

The aim of this project is to measure different projects with respect to various metrics and analyze the correlation between these metrics. The metrics being studied are enlisted below, followed by the open-source projects they are being applied on.

#### Metrics
1. **Statement Coverage:** measurement procedure wherein the number of lines of code covered under certain circumstances is calculated based on the inputs from the users.
2. **Branch Coverage:** Branch coverage is a measurement to calculate the number of branches executed per user input.
3. **Mutation Score:** Mutation score is a testing practice wherein we check the accuracy or precision of the test cases.
4. **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Cyclomatic Complexity is the measure number of linearly independent paths that can be executed in a program.
5. **Adaptive Maintenance Effort Model (AMEffMo)**: a model for estimating adaptive maintenance effort
6. **Software Defect Density**: the number of defects per size of the software or application area of the software
